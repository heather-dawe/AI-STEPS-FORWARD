# AI-STEPS-FORWARD
A repo for the Common Data Model (CDM) and associated material for AI Assurance using the AI STEPS FORWARD framework

The purpose of this repository is to provide a boilerplate Common Data Model (CDN) for AI Assurance using the AI STEPS FORWARD framework, defined in <a href="#">Responsible AI in the Enterprise</a> (Masood & Dawe, 2023). 

Discussed further in our book, at the time of writing, AI Assurance is a movable feast, but Enterprises still have a responsibility to develop and deploy AI that is fair, ethical and safe. Recognising this, we have designed this CDM to both cover all current aspects of AI Assurance and to be extensible, enabling further developmenty by the given Enterprise. As much as possible we seek to enable immediate use of this CDM for AI Assurance, but also recognise that modification may be necessary for specific Use Cases.

Along with the CDM, examplar user journeys and Apps driven by the data model are available. These show how using the AI STEPS FORWARD common data model as the data model for an application facilitates AI Assurance processes to become data-driven with the Enterprise, yielding auditable AI processes and considerable efficiency.
